# B-Task-CLI
A lightweight, easy to use CLI task manager. 
by Brendan P. 

## About
Todo lists are a staple in your programming journey. Thousands are out there, but I wanted something more. 
This CLI task manager is built off of Jon Calhouns task manager from his "Gophercises" courses,
with some  tweaks and customization. 
I wanted to learn how to build a full CLI from start to finish, and learned so much more about Go than I expected.
It is fun finding new things that Go can do, all while keeping clean and readable.

## Installation 
- Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/brendisurfs/B-Task-CLI/releases) and download the correct build for your OS.
- alternatively, you may clone this repo and build it from source (having Go installed is required). 
- for Macos and Linux, run the shell script.
- For Windows, read the In Progress notes below.


## In Progress
- Writing Windows installer. 
- more color variety with the CLI output.
- ability to complete ("do") multiple tasks in a one liner.
